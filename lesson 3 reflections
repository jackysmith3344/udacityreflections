When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For security - its useful to have a cloud backup
If there are several people working on a project
If you want to ask other people's advice

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to include everyones input into your version yet
If you're experimenting and you might want to step back to a previous version (although there are other ways to do this)
