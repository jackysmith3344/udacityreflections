What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a .git directory with a standard set of subdirs to hold the metadata about the files in the directory & you prepare a list of files that you might want to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives you a chance to try out how things look before you commit anything.

NOTES  "git diff" - compares the files in the working area & the files in the staging area
       "git diff --staged" compares the files in the working area with the commit that's currently in use
It's a good idea to use these routinely BEFORE creating a commit.
   	   "git reset --hard" drops all the changes to files in the working area, permanently - no way to get them back.
       ONLY use this when you've used git diff & git diff --staged to make sure you're getting rid of something you really want to get rid of.
