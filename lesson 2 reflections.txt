What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a .git directory with a standard set of subdirs to hold the metadata about the files in the directory & you prepare a list of files that you might want to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area gives you a chance to try out how things look before you commit anything.
